I am a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/varun.kanade/myindex.html" target="_blank">Varun Kanade</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rebeschi/" target="_blank">Patrick Rebeschini</a>. I obtained an MSc in <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/students/postgraduate-courses/msc-mfocs" target="_blank">Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Sience</a> at the University of Oxford and a <a href="https://www.ucm.es/estudios/grado-informaticaymatematicas-plan" target="_blank">double Bachelor</a> in Mathematics and in Computer Science at the Complutense University of Madrid. 

### Research

I am interested in optimization and fields that interplay with it, like statistical machine learning and probability. I have worked on non-convex problems, Riemannian geodesically convex optimization, accelerated algorithms, online optimization, and bandit problems.
